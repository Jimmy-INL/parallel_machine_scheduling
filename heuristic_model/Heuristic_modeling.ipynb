    "## Parallel Machine Scheduling Heuristic modeling\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel machine scheduling problems with release constraints, $Pm|r_j|\\sum C_j$, has been proved NP-hard in strong sense. This repository is to use Branch and Bound algorithm to solve it, as well as an approximate algorithm, SRPT-CONVERT. The code is implemented in C and Python-API is wrapped with Cython package.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "$M$ machines needs to process $N$ jobs. Each job is associated with a release constraint and a process time interval. Each machine is not available to start processing jobs until the available time is up to (processing some jobs not in $N$ jobs). The objective is to have the machines finish processing all jobs. The result is to have the Gantt chart to express the schedule of the whole machines. \n",

    "- Input: \n",
    "  - request_ids: ids of jobs to be processed;\n",
    "  - release_times: time interval of jobs released to be processed;\n",

    "- SRPT-CONVERT:\n",
    "  - Delete the non-preemptive constraint to change the problem to a P-solvable problem, $Pm|r_j, pmtm|\\sum C_i$, by releasing the non-preemptive constraints.\n",
    "  - CONVERT algorithm is used to transform the preemptive schedules to non-preemptive one.\n",

    "### Exact algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- Branch and bound search\n",
    "  - Bounds I:\n",
    "    -  $Pm||\\sum C_i$, delete release constraints;\n",
    "    - Solution: Shortest-Process-Time (SPT)\n",
    "  - Bounds II:\n",
